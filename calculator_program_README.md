In the calculator mini program, I asked the user to input two numerical values and initialize them to the variables, num1 and num2.
I placed input statements under a try block, to make sure that no error occurs if the user enters a non-numerical value.

I made multiple functions to add, subtract, multiply, divide and to exponentiate these numbers.
In division, I made separate functions to return the final answer, the quotient, and the remainder.

Then, I made a while loop, asking the users to enter a specific number to choose an operation of their choice.
I also asked them to enter -1 to terminate the program.

Depending on the choice the user enters, the specific mathematical operation will be performed on the two numbers.
